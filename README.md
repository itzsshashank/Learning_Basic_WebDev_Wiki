## Beginner's Web Development Learning Project: Exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Welcome to the **LearningWebBasics** project, where I'm humbly embracing the journey of web development as a beginner and enthusiastic learner. This project is a testament to my early steps into the vast world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With curiosity as my compass, I've woven together the basics of web technologies to create an educational experience.

## Project Overview:

In this project, I've created a series of interconnected web pages that introduce the foundational technologies that power the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **index.html:**

- **css.html:**

- **javascript.html:**

### Interlinking Pages:

By creating hyperlinks between the pages, I've made navigation seamless, allowing visitors to explore different aspects of web development effortlessly. The interlinked pages mirror my growing understanding of connecting web elements.
